# gorillasJS
Practice / Portfolio project for JS

WIP!

Pseudo-clone of the game Gorillas.bas that came with MS-DOS's QBasic.

Some aspects will be ported (e.g. drawings' dimensions) and some will be 
written from scratch while trying different implementations (or to 
improve on some aspect)

Test the current state here:
